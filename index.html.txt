<p>According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly.
<br>Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground.<br>The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care what humans think is impossible.<br>Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black.<br>Ooh, black and yellow! Let's shake it up a little.
<br>Barry! Breakfast is ready
<br>Coming!
<br>Hang on a second. Hello?
<br>Barry?
<br>Adam?
<br>Can you believe this is happening?
<br>I can't. I'll pick you up.
<br>Looking sharp.
<br>Use the stairs. Your father paid good money for those.<br>Sorry. I'm excited.
<br>Here's the graduate. We're very proud of you, son.
<br>A perfect report card, all B's.
<br>Very proud.
<br>Ma! I got a thing going here.
<br>You got lint on your fuzz.
<br>Ow! That's me!
<br>Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000.
<br>Bye!
<br>Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house!
<br>Hey, Adam.
<br>Hey, Barry.
<br>Is that fuzz gel?
<br>A little. Special day, graduation.
<br>Never thought I'd make it.
<br>Three days grade school, three days high school.
<br>Those were awkward.
<br>Three days college. I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around the hive.
<br>You did come back different.</p>
